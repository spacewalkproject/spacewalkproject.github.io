                                <p><a href="http://rhn.redhat.com/">Red Hat Network</a> (RHN Classic) first started in
                                    2001 as a hosted
                                    service. RHN later spawned a stand-alone product called <a

                                        Satellite</a>.
                                    Spacewalk as a project officially became an open source, community driven project in
                                    June 2008, and

                                <p>Red Hat's continued commitment to open source technology and the open source
                                    development model drove
                                    the release of Spacewalk in 2008. By releasing the Satellite code base, Red Hat
                                    enhanced its ability
                                    to incorporate new open source management
                                    projects into the future roadmap for its products and solutions.</p>

                                <p>The Spacewalk project and the Red Hat Satellite product fully support and believe
                                    that community
                                    participation is a critical success factor for any open source initiative.</p>

                                    There are
                                    various reasons why a feature in Spacewalk may or may not become a part of
                                    Satellite.
                                    For example, a Spacewalk feature will not be accepted into Satellite if it does not
                                    meet Red Hat
                                    quality standards or if it does not comply with the vision and goals that Red Hat
                                    has set for the
                                    Satellite product.
                                </p>

                                <p>When a given feature is accepted in Spacewalk and has been approved to be included in
                                    the Satellite
                                    product, it will likely be made available in the next major release of Satellite,
                                    depending on
                                    timing (it may be too late to make the next
                                    release, but it might make the following release.)</p>

                                    Red Hat Satellite 6 is a re-engineering of the Red Hat Satellite product. Spacewalk
                                    (and its
                                    downstream product, Red Hat Satellite 5) is a systems-management tool, and Satellite
                                    6 is designed
                                    to accomplish the same set of goals. However, Satellite 6 has
                                    been built from the ground-up on different and more modern technologies. Spacewalk
                                    is <em>not</em>
                                    the upstream for Satellite 6, and never will be. Instead Satellite 6 is a federation
                                    of several
                                    upstream open source projects,

                                    Given that the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/satellite">Red

                                    through June of 2019, Red Hat will continue
                                    working on and contributing to Satellite 5 for a long time to come. Spacewalk will
                                    remain the
                                    upstream for Satellite 5, and Red Hat will continue to push up the work it does for
                                    the benefit of
                                    the open source community.

                                    However, that is not to say that nothing will change. Currently, Red Hat maintains a
                                    controlling
                                    interest in the Spacewalk project, in the form of the majority of code commits,
                                    ownership and
                                    maintenance of much of the infrastructure and builders, management
                                    and orchestration of Spacewalk releases, etc. As Red Hat's participation in
                                    Satellite 5 / Spacewalk
                                    decreases in the upcoming years, that will have to change.

                                    all over the world and from many different companies. As Red Hat's participation
                                    ramps down, there
                                    will be an opportunity for the participation from other community members to ramp
                                    up. Someone (or
                                    several someones!) will need to take over
                                    some of the management role that currently rests on Red Hat. What exactly that will
                                    look like is
                                    still an open question, and one that the Spacewalk community will need to be talking
                                    about over the

                                    Regardless of how that plays out, the project will not simply disappear overnight.
                                    As long as people

                                    spirit, there is no reason that the project and community
